# HTML forms validation demo for Yandex Praktikum

## About

Demo application developed at the request of [Yandex Praktikum](https://practicum.com/) students. The goal was to demonstrate the new features of HTML5 forms and how to use them to implement form validations in plain HTML without JavaScript.

Good references for HTML form validation are available on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/%D0%92%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D1%8B) and [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp).
